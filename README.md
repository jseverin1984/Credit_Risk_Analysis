# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

For this analysis, I was asked to evaluate credit card credit data from LendingClub. I was tasked to predict if someone, based off of a
specific feature set, would fall into the high credit risk or low credit risk category. The goal would be to help LendingClub make better
decisions when approving of denying credit.  I will be using three different methods to resample the data in order to provide better
predictive outcomes.  I will use Random Over Sampling, SMOTE, and Cluster Centroid algorithms to resample the data, then use logistic
regression machine learning to train the resampled data. Lastly, I will run fresh data through the trained algorithm and use quantitative
measures to compare the three resampling techniques for their ability to provide a more accurate prediction alogrithm. I will also try
two more machine learning models, Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier, to see if they can provide a better
prediction model.
